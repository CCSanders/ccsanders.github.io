                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        I am Colin Sanders, a software developer from Fort Worth, Texas.
                        I am currently studying Computer Science and Economics at the University of Alabama,
                        expected to graduate in May 2021. <br>
                        I have experience in full-stack web application development and video game
                        development, and I am interested in machine learning,
                        economic modelling, dev-team enablement, and just about every other technology
                        related topic. <br>
                        I love to code, I'm a great problem solver and quick learner, and I love to work
                        with other people! <br>
                        Please have a look at my past experience and projects, and feel free to contact me
                        below if you have any questions or just want to connect.
                        Have a great day!

                                My goal as a Unity Student Ambassador is to support the game development scene at the University of Alabama
                                through organizing and running workshops and game-jams. As of December 2019, I have led one workshop titled 
                                "Introduction to Game Development with Unity", and am in the process of planning an intermediate-level 
                                game-dev workshop and a week-long game-jam for early 2020.

                                Worked on an internal Lockheed Martin full-stack data management and tracking application. 
                                The software assisted the F35 program by providing real-time dataon factors that could potentially 
                                limit the production of the jet. The team I was on used Agile principles across one-week sprints. 
                                I worked on functionality across the whole stack of the web-app, which was built with an Angular frontend, 
                                Dotnet Core API, and SQL Server backend. I also worked as the Scrum Master and developer for an intern side assignment, 
                                where I led a team of 6 intern-developers to create an indoor mapping and navigation app for Lockheed Martin facilities. 
                                My contributions and productivity throughout my internship led me to be offered a part-time, remote position throughout 
                                the school year as a developer on the same team.

                            tooling division of the F35 Fighter Jet Program. My primary responsibility was extending the functionality of in internal Lockeed Martin program
                            to better catch unknown error messages. The stack for this including a JavaScript / HTML frontend, a Java web service API, and a backend that included

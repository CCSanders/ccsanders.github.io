### **Why I started my blog**

Although I am an avid reader of Twitter, I rarely finding myself actually pouring my thoughts to my X number of Twitter followers. Most of them I know in real life, and likely don't want to hear how I felt about that new game or how I figured out how to finally get some Angular feature to work. So in developing my portfolio website, I figured it would be pretty cool to give myself that environment to discuss what is on my mind and maybe even create articles to help others do the things I'm trying to do, whether that's technology related or otherwise. 

Plus, I figured it would be pretty cool to create a custom blog engine on my website. As of right now (June 28th, 2020) it basically consists of dynamically loading a blog-article data object that has meta-data related to an article (author, length, date written, summary) and a link to a markdown file that consists of the actual content of the article. I found an Angular package that automatically renders MD all nice and pretty (including code syntax-highlighting and emoji support), [ngx-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-markdown), and added the route structure to do so based on article-id. I learned a lot throughout the implementation of these features, so certainly reach out to me if you want to learn more (I might do a full post on the implementation).

### **What and when will I be posting in the future**

This is where this whole blog-thing gets pretty tricky. I am not placing any goals or restrictions on myself to pump out content at a semi-reasonable pace. I will purely write when I feel like writing. When I do get on a creative kick, you'll find anything on this blog from general thoughts, reviews on recent movies and games, technology explorations, how-tos, hackathon experiences, projects I'm working on, insights on the extravaganza of internship / job-hunting, and more! Not only will I be writing on this, but in order to keep some sort of content stream going, I will be inviting some writer friends of mine to post their thoughts.

I have a few articles planned for the immediate future as I roll-out the initial workings of this platform: This post, a replication of a post I made on PCPartPicker regarding the building of my new computer, some video game reviews (The Current State of Destiny 2), and more. And as always, if anybody wants to see specific content, I am always open to suggestions and can be contacted on my home page. 

### **What am I up to right now**

Although the state of the world is in a smidge of disarray, 2020 has been a pretty solid year for me. Although the semester ended early and concluded remotely, I finished up my junior year of classes at the University of Alabama in the Spring, of which I scraped by another semester on the President's List (4.0 GPA). Not only this, but I also received the UACS Senior Honors award. Outside of school, I was working on a city-builder mobile game in Unity towards the beginning of the year, but became quite busy in February and never picked it back up again. In May, I started my 3rd internship with Lockheed Martin, working on internal software with the same team I was on last summer. Since May, I studied and passed my Amazon Web Services Cloud Practitioner certification, as I've recently become interested in the cloud and how it affects our applications. Also, I have been accepted to the University of Alabama Graduate School and UACS Accelerated Masters Program, and adjusted my Fall 2020 schedule to include 6 hours of graduate level computer science. I am excited to get back to school and can only hope that things begin to return to normal as social distancing measures amp up. 

If you have read this far, I greatly appreciate you taking the time out of your day to learn about me and my platform. 

Stay safe,

Colin
